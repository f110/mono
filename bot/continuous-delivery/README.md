# continuous-delivery bot

This is the GitHub Apps.
This bot is responsible for build, ship to the container registry and some jobs.

# Development & Debugging

This bot will be triggered by github webhook.
Development and debugging is harder than other software.

I often use a real request of webhook through L7 proxy like [lagrangian-proxy](https://github.com/f110/lagrangian-proxy).
