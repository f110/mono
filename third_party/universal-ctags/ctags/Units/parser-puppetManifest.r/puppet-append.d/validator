# The puppet validator reports this input as "invalid" because
# += operator is obsoleted in puppet5.
# @ahakanbaba in #1909 reported and proposed a fix for this already.
#
# However, @masatake kept this as is for following reasons:
#
# - valid in puppet4,
# - testing KNOWN-INVALIDATION special validator, and
# - testing '#' comment in a validator file.

KNOWN-INVALIDATION
