# Contributing to pkg.go.dev

Pkg.go.dev is part of the Go open source project. We would love to receive your
contributions!

Since we are actively working on the site, we ask that you
[file an issue](https://golang.org/s/discovery-feedback) and claim it before
starting to work on something. Otherwise, it is likely that we might already be
working on a fix for your issue.

Because we are currently working on
[design updates to pkg.go.dev](/README.md#roadmap), we will not be accepting
any contributions for
[issues with a UX label](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ago.dev+label%3AUX).

## Finding issues

All issues are labeled with the
[`go.dev` label](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ago.dev).
Issues that are suitable for contributors are additionally tagged with the
[`help wanted` label](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ago.dev+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+).

Before you begin working on an issue, please leave a comment that you are claiming it.
