# Worker

The _worker_ populates the database with information about new modules.

For additional information on functionality of the worker, see the
[design document](design.md).

## Development

The main program lives in `cmd/worker`.

You can run the worker locally like so:

```
go run cmd/worker/main.go
```

### Populating data locally using the worker

When run locally, the worker uses an in-memory queue. This implementation has
bounded parallelism (configurable via the `-workers` flag) but does not
automatically retry failures.

In order to populate local versions, you can either fetch the version explicitly
(via `http://localhost:8000/fetch/path/to/package/@v/v1.2.3`), or you can visit the
Worker dashboard, and click 'Enqueue from module index'. This will enqueue the
next N versions from the index for processing.
