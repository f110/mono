# Frontend

The _frontend_ presents user-facing web pages on pkg.go.dev.

For additional information on functionality of the frontend, see the
[design document](design.md).

## Development

The main program lives in `cmd/frontend`. The bulk of the code lives in
`internal/frontend`.

You can run the frontend locally like so:

```
go run cmd/frontend/main.go [-dev] [-direct_proxy]
```

- The `-dev` flag reloads templates on each page load.

The frontend can use one of two datasources:

- Postgres database
- proxy service

The `Datasource` interface implementation is available at internal/datasource.go.

You can use the `-direct_proxy` flag to run the frontend with its datasource as
the proxy service. This allows you to run the frontend without setting up a
postgres database.

Alternatively, you can run pkg.go.dev with a local database. See instructions
on how to [set up](postgres.md) and
[populate](worker.md#populating-data-locally-using-the-worker)
your local database with packages of your choice.

You can then run the frontend with: `go run cmd/frontend/main.go`
