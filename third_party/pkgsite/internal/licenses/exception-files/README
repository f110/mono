The files in this directory (except this one) are processed by gen_exceptions.go
to produce a map of exceptions to license detection.

Each file begins with a header consisting of one or more lines of the form
	key: value
and ending in a blank line.

The only required keys are:
	types: a space-separated list of the file types to report for the file
	source: a URL or other indication of where the license came from 

IF YOU ADD A FILE, RUN go generate.
