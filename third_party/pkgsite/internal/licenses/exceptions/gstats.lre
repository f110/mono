By default, gstats uses https://github.com/cevatbarisyilmaz/ip2country for geolocation,
which internally uses [GeoLite2](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/)  database by Maxmind.
As GeoLite2 is distributed under
[Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/),
gstats also uses the same license due to license's terms.

However, you can override the geolocation function to use another geolocation source
or maybe to not use geolocation at all. In this case, you can use gstats with
[MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
